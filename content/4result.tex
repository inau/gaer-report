\section{Results}
Several experiments were performed using the evaluation function mentioned in 
section \ref{sec:evaluation}. 

Initially the experiments were carried out without the interactive term, $I$,
and without regard for the mass of the individuals produced by the EC. This
meant that the physical part of the evaluation, where Ethan was dropped on the
individuals, resulted in the terms, $E_\Delta$, $E_{rest}$, and
$E_{posture}$ all being roughly equal. This happened because the higher mass of
Ethan would always result in the individuals being rotated and Ethan dropping
on the floor. This left only the $|V|$ and $R_c$ terms, and the EC ultimately
optimized towards a minimal voxel count which would not rotate when Ethan was
dropped, see figure~\ref{fig:flat_object}.

\caption{The evolved object, pink, is simply a flat structure, such that it 
does not rotate when Ethan is dropped on it, and has minimal voxel count.}
\label{fig:flat_object}
\end{figure}

Adding the interactive term, $I$, did not improve significantly on the above
results. While the selected individual would persist through several
generations, the other best performing individuals would still optimize towards
the aforementioned flat structure, see figure~\ref{fig:selection}.

Further experiments were conducted, where the mass of the individuals was
adjusted according to their voxel count. In these experiments the EC ended up
producing some individuals which were not just flat objects. Rather it 
produced individuals as boxes on which Ethan could rest in a height such that
the terms $E_{rest}$ and $E_\Delta$ were minimized, see 
figure~\ref{fig:boxchair}.

individuals are more sturdy, the EC evolved a box upon which Ethan could rest.}
