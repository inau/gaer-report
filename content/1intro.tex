\section{Introduction}
Computer aided evolution(CAE) operates within the domain of evolutionary
biology, in the sense that it attempts to replicate the darwinistic view, namely
evolution by natural selection and survival of the fittest\cite{paper:ev3}.

Genetic algorithms provide a Darwinian framework for local search algorithms.
Dividing the sub problems of optimization into encoding, selection n, and
evaluation\cite{paper:ev3}. \todo[inline]{expand (a little) on general bio evo,
and how it transfers to compsci}

Ultimately the goal with such evolution in our case is to develop candidates
which are not the most obvious design choices from a human perspective, but
score a higher grade compared to already known solutions.

\todo[inline]{dette kunne muligvis rykkes til previous work istedet} An example
of such results are space antennas developed by Gregory S.
Hornby\cite{paper:ev4} using generative Computer-Automated Evolutionary
Design[See figure \ref{fig:nasa_antenna}]. These antennas have rather
controversal designs compared to the traditional archetype of an antenna.
\todo[inline]{Move example and figures out of introduction, they belong
elsewhere me thinks}

Building from such previous experiences, that something which usually has a
standardized morphology can get so fundamentally different results when applying
CAE, leads us to wanting to apply such methodology to other domains.

The chosen domain is within furniture, namely the types which should be suited
for seating.

One might wonder why this is relevant in our current time or in the future?

By being able to produce solutions which are outside of traditional design norms
some of the problems in modern society can be dealt with, problems such as high
resource consumption and strain on the environment when treating the resources.

Since there is a finite amount of raw materials and treatment of aforementioned
resources in the general case results in strain on the environment be it
foraging for wood or producing plastics this project is deemed highly relevant.
\todo[inline]{I would scratch this, and justify the evo of furniture with the
claim that it is a classical design issue, and that it is complex enough to test
the bounderies (maybe too strong a claim) of evolution}

By tweaking the parameters to optimize for material or comfort, the candidate
solutions might provide some very interesting and hopefully revolutionary
designs.

Designs which ultimately might save the world. \todo[inline]{No world saving and
revolutionizing please, such claims only antagonize the people who actually work
in the field}
