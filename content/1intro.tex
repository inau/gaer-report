\section{Introduction}
Computer aided evolution is becoming increasingly popular for tasks which involve creating models which have been optimized for certain characteristica.
Ultimately the goal with such evolution is to develop solutions which are not the most obvious design choices from a human perspective, but perform superior to already known solutions.\\

An example of such a results is a space antenna developed at NASA[See figure \ref{fig:nasa_antenna}], which has a rather controversal design. While most antennas are somewhat straight in a direction this particular antenna is revolving around itself.

This project focusses on using computer aided evolution to generate models for furniture, particularly for the activity of sitting.
