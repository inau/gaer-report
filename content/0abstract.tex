The field of Evolutionary Computation has many prior examples of objects being
generated by simulated evolution.
Examples of prior work include tables evolved using generative encoding
and images evolved by applying CPPNs and interactive evolutionary computation.
Our work applies CPPN-NEAT to evolving chairs, chair design being a
classical design challenge. This particular angle on evolutionary computations
ensures that we have repetition, symmetry and regularities in the candidates.
The results produced by the network are quite diverse, with the most frequently
recurring shapes being trays, boxes and baskets. The trays and baskets could
potentially develop to something more similar to seating furniture known from
the present, while the boxes already have some similarities to present day
furniture While using CPPNs for creating chairs seems as it potentially could
create some candidates suitable for sitting, we have not been able to produce
many viable or novel chairs, but did see some interesting results.
