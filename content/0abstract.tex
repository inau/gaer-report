Research within the field of evolutionary computations has prior examples of objects being generated
by applying artificial neural networks or variations of such.
Examples of prior work are tables using generative encoding, space antennas which initially were seeded with bad performing designs.

which revolves around creating tables, space antennas and the likes with generative encoding
have proven to be quite efficient.
