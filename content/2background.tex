\textbf{PAPERS AND CONTEXT}
Evolutionary Algorithms have been used to develop similar solutions before. Examples of previous  applications are tables[See figure \ref{fig:hornby_tables}] where the optimisation parameters were height of the support structure, stability of the structure and maximization of surface area.

While the evolution of tables has some similarities to seating they are inherent
different in the sense that maximized surface area might not be ideal for a
chair nor would very high legs be seing the physical attributes of humans
usually constrain us to some specific height range which is optimal for the
average persons seating comfort.
