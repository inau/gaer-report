\section{Introduction}
Computer driven evolution is neat, HYPER-NEAT some might say.\\

Imagine which results one might discover when trying to apply evolutionary algorithms to develop items which traditionally have been developed by people.\\

That is what has been utilized in this project - the goal has been to try and develop chairs using evolutionary algorithms ultimately to discover some new and exciting solutions to the old and well known problem of designing chairs for human beings.
