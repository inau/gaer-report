\section{Method}
This section expects the reader to have basic knowledge about evolutionary algorithms and neural networks.\\

A solution using the Unity3D\cite{web:unity} game engine has been built. This has been done by building on a collegues work with evolutionary algorithms, particularly a project porting SharpNeat\cite{web:unityneat} to the Unity gameengine\cite{web:sharpneat}. While this is not directly applicable to our solution it supplied us with a framework for setting up evolutionary algorithms.\\

NEAT is short for neuro-evolution by augmenting topologies, its a technique which applies three key concepts to build complex neural networks, history, speciation and complexiation. First and foremost history is the 
    
\textbf{Unity} was an arbitrary choice. We could just as easily have chosen any other game engine which provided the same components - particularly physics and rendering, however Unity is used by thousands of people worldwide and has a lot of support provided by its active community which really works in favor of the engine.
