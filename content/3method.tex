\section{Method}
This section expects the reader to have basic knowledge about evolutionary algorithms and neural networks.

\subsection{Theory}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item CPPN
    \item Marching Cubes
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Software}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Unity3D
    \item UnityNeat - SharpNeat port to Unity3D
    \item MarchingCubes implementation for Unity3D
\end{enumerate}
    
\textbf{Unity} was an arbitrary choice. We could just as easily have chosen any other game engine which provided the same components - particularly physics and rendering, however Unity is used by thousands of people worldwide and has a lot of support provided by its active community which really works in favor of the engine.
